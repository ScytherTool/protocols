# Scyther Protocol Models

These are examples of protocols that can be modelled in Scyther.
Scyther protocols are defined in files with a `.spdl` file extension.

## For Developers

- Syntax highlighting and editor support for these files is available in the
[dsl](https://github.com/ScytherTool/dsl) project.
- The implementation that reads these files is defined in the
[core](https://github.com/ScytherTool/core) project.
